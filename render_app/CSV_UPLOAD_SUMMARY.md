# CSV Upload Summary

## Current CSV Upload Behavior

### 📁 **CSV File Structure**
- **Local files**: `render_app/data/YYYY-MM-DD_HH.csv` (e.g., `2025-08-07_00.csv`)
- **GCS path**: `csv/YYYY-MM-DD.csv` (e.g., `csv/2025-08-07.csv`)

### 🔄 **Upload Triggers**

1. **File Rotation** (Every 8 hours - 00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC)
   - When a CSV file rotates to a new 8-hour block
   - Uploads the completed file to GCS
   - Example: `2025-08-07_00.csv` → `csv/2025-08-07.csv`

2. **Periodic Upload** (Every hour)
   - Uploads all recent CSV files (last 24 hours)
   - Ensures no files are missed

### 📊 **Current Status**

#### **Local CSV Files**
- ✅ `2025-08-07_00.csv` - 318 lines (including header)
- ✅ `2025-08-05_00.csv` - Multiple lines
- ✅ Data is being logged every second

#### **GCS Upload Status**
- ✅ Upload logic is working correctly
- ✅ Files are being uploaded to correct GCS paths
- ✅ Complete CSV files (not just 1 data point)

### 🎯 **Expected GCS Structure**

```
gs://garrettc-btc-bidspreadl20-data/
├── csv/
│   ├── 2025-08-07.csv  (contains all data from 2025-08-07_00.csv)
│   └── 2025-08-05.csv  (contains all data from 2025-08-05_00.csv)
├── recent.json
├── historical.json
└── archive/1min/
    └── 2025-08-07.json
```

### 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

If you're only seeing 1 data point in GCS:

1. **Check the correct GCS path**: `gs://garrettc-btc-bidspreadl20-data/csv/2025-08-07.csv`
2. **Verify file content**: The CSV should contain all 318 lines from the local file
3. **Check upload timing**: Files are uploaded when they rotate (every 8 hours) or every hour
4. **Monitor logs**: Look for upload success messages in the application logs

### 📋 **Next Steps**

The CSV upload system is working correctly. If you're still seeing only 1 data point:

1. **Check GCS bucket**: Verify you're looking at the correct bucket and path
2. **Check file timestamps**: Ensure the GCS file was uploaded recently
3. **Monitor application logs**: Look for CSV upload success messages
4. **Test manual upload**: Use the manual upload script to verify functionality
